Coming out of a global pandemic, there has been high inflation, two wars, and an increasingly divided Republican Party. While Schwarzenegger has remained popular through it all, most are ready for a change. Incumbent Vice President Lindsey Graham faces off against former Democratic Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla and SpaceX. Is the country finally ready to put the Democrats back in the Oval Office? Or can Graham ride the popularity of Schwarzenegger to offset his own unpopularity and the third election in a row with a strong third-party campaign?</p>",
