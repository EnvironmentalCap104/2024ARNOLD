Coming out of a global pandemic, there has been high inflation, two wars, and an increasingly divided Republican Party. While Schwarzenegger has remained popular through it all, most are ready for a change. Incumbent Vice President Lindsey Graham faces off against former Democratic Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla and SpaceX. Is the country finally ready to put the Democrats back in the Oval Office? Or can Graham ride the popularity of Schwarzenegger to offset his own unpopularity and the third election in a row with a strong third-party campaign?</p>",

The son of former Democratic Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, he is an interesting figure, and a popular one. Defeating the unpopular incumbent Governor Matt Bevin in deep-red Kentucky in 2019, he has had widespread popularity there. He is a foil to President Arnold Schwarzenegger in some ways, in that he is a centrist for his party and is a Democratic governor from a red state. Kentucky is unlikely to vote blue, but his moderate positions can be crucial to win the Midwest and Southeast, where third-parties have played spoiler in the era of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

She even faced a kidnapping plot by a far-right militia group over her response to the COVID-19 pandemic right before the 2020 presidential election. Whitmer enjoys immense popularity in Michigan and the rest of the critical Midwest, and among working-class, suburban, and female voters. Choosing your top primary rival is expected to help unite the party after such a divisive primary, and bring suburban women into the Democratic ticket for 2024.</p>",

He shares a lot of similarities with Barack Obama, with his experience in the Senate and his charisma. He would be the first African-American Vice President of the United States. He is also the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the same church that Martin Luther King Jr was a pastor. If Warnock can energize African-Americans like he did in his Senate races, he can score crucial wins for your ticket in the four Southeastern states that nearly went blue due to Republican vote splitting the last two times: Virginia, North Carolina, his home state of Georgia, and the all-important battleground of Florida.</p>",
